## What is Shiny?

* An R package for building interactive web applications.
* Open source.  Developed by R Studio.
* Rmarkdown and knitr are great but not interactive.
* Share data analysis without need for programming.

***

## Motivation
* Too much data to make simple overview plots.
* Models too complex for a few simple diagnostics.
* Working with non-R users.
* User facing applications built on top of R.

***

## Examples

* https://gallery.shinyapps.io/Ebola-Dynamic/
* Graphics generated using ggplot2
* Slider controls feedback input to ggplot2
* Plots regenerate when controls change

***

## How does it work?

* Uses R as a backend for data.
* Use R data structures, R packages and R graphics.
* Front end built using HTML, Javascript and CSS.
* No HTML, Javascript or CSS knowledge necessary.

***

## Advanced Options

* Supports integration with D3.js.
* Support for many libraries built on top of D3.
* Dygraphs, leaflet, Google charts and others.
* Custom CSS and javascript.

--- 

## Requirements

* For running shiny code locally
  - R
  - Shiny Package (on CRAN)
* For hosting web applications
  - Linux server
  - Shiny-server software

## Simple example User Interface

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
shinyUI(
  fluidPage(
    titlePanel("Hello World!"),

    sidebarPanel(
      sliderInput("obs", 
        "Number of observations:", 
        min = 1,
        max = 1000, 
        value = 500)
    ),
    # Show a plot of the generated distribution
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("distPlot")
    )
  )
)
```

***

## Simple example Server Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

# Define server logic required to generate and plot a random distribution
shinyServer(
  function(input, output) {
    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
      dist <- rnorm(input$obs)
      hist(dist)
    })
  }
)
```

***

## Shiny design flow
* User interface contained in `shinyUI` function -- often in its own file: `ui.R`.
* Server logic contained inside `shinyServer` -- often in its own file: `server.R`.
* User interface, takes user input and displays output.
  - Controls buttons, messages, menus etc.
  - Can be built without any HTML, CSS or Javascript knowledge.
* Server function take input from UI and has full access to R packages.

***

## Reactive Programming

```{r, eval=FALSE}
A = 100
B = A + 1
A = 200
```

What is the value of `B` at the end of this code segment?

* Normal R: `B == 101`
* Reactive R: `B == 201`

***

## Shiny logic flow

* Data input from "Reactive Source"
  - Typically user input from browser interface.
  - Example: select an item, click a button, enter in a value.
* Data from "Reactive Source" processed using R
  - Take user input and run further calculations.
  - Example: calculate summary statistics on user input data.
* Data output as "Reactive endpoint"
  - Reactive endpoint displays result to user.
  - Example: Plot data after processing.

***

## More complicated example

***

## Reactive Types
* Reactive Source
* Reactive Conductor
* Reactive Endpoint
